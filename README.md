# financial-analysis
I'm a financial analytics intern, I analyze stock's ups and downs, do presentations and explain why it is buy,sell or hold.
Recently I found out that the prices of the companies with small caps goes up in the beginning of the year and drops in the end of the year, and my professor gave me a task to collect the data, do calculations, visualizations and to prove it.
I downloaded the data from the broker-fidelity and did calculations like average return, seasonality, standard deviation and statistical method ANOVA.
Also worked on visualizations and figured that the price goes up in January and June.
Now I'll work on data for January vs June, January vs other months.
